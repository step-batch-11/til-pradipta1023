- What _clicked_ today?
- control statements in shell, p5js animations, creating own snippets of
  javascript
- What changed in your understanding?
- shell is a language because it has control structure as well.
- What would you explain differently now?
- Now I can generate my own snippets, I can do a whole bunch of animation stuff
  using p5js

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:

- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

  using strings?”
- “How do the functions of p5js work? Like rectangle, traingle, circle etc.”

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

- A REPL experiment
- A minimal snippet
- A variation of today’s code
