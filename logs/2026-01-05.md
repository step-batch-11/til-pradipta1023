# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What _clicked_ today?
- I have learnt about perlin noise
- Learnt how to take prompt asyncronously using deno.stdin.readable. Learnt
  about TextDecoder and TextEncoder
- What changed in your understanding?
- I learnt that perlin noise outputs which are not like random. It gives output
  which is always between 0 and 1. It's always nearer to its previous output.
- Deno.stdin.readable allows us to take inputs one after another. It's like
  iterators.
- What would you explain differently now?
- perlin noise doesn't behave like random.
- I can encode message using new TextEncoder().encode(message) to Unit8Array.

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully?
- Deno.stdin.writable
- What would you like to see one more example of?
- What feels fragile in your understanding?

---

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:

- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- “What will I increase the xOff of perlin noise very high”
- “When we're writing is it waiting for us or running asyncronously? I would
  like to see an example”

---

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- A REPL experiment
- A minimal snippet
- A variation of today’s code

# One-Sentence Summary

Finish this sentence:

> Today was useful because **I learnt about perlin noise little. I learnt about
> Deno.stdin.readable and writable. I learnt how to create a structured project
> so that if someone just runs a setup file then everything will automatically
> be set up.**.
