# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What _clicked_ today?
- test coverage will test all the lines in source folder which we're testing
- What changed in your understanding?
- conversion from files to stream can be done (practice)
- What would you explain differently now?

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully?
- parse using class inside that pick and pop functions
- What would you like to see one more example of?
- Converting files to stream
- What feels fragile in your understanding?

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:

- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions
- How to use lines and bytes when its needed while i'll use stream for both?
- How will it work for stdin when i'll give input from keyboard?
- “Why does X behave differently when Y?”
- “What breaks if I remove Z?”
- “How does this scale / fail / degrade?”

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- I'll create a Class for the whole parser
- A REPL experiment
- A minimal snippet
- A variation of today’s code
